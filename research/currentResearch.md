I am a PhD student working at Prof. Partick Chinnery's lab, at MRC-MBU, University of Cambridge. 

The lab focuses on mitochondrial genomics. Mitochodria are the major source of energy in the cell and have their own genome, mutation in such genome cause mitochondrial diseases. As a group, we are interested in studying the cellular mechanisms that underlie these rare diseases.

My project aims at understanding how mitochondrial mutations accumulate in different tissues. Indeed, it is known that cell types are differently vulnerable to mitochondrial mutations, thus depicting a mosaic landscape within any given tissue. 
I am mostly interested in studying the effects of accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations on the transcriptome, at single cell resolution.
